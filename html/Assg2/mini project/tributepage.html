	<p><b>Albert Einstein</b> was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. 
		He is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula E = mcÂ², which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".</p>
	<p>Einstein received the <b>Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921</b> "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".</p>
	<p>He died on April 18, 1955, at the age of 76.In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. 
		Einstein, as a Jew, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government;[19] he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.
		[20] On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. 
		Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons</p>
