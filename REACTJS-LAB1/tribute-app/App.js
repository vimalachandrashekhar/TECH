        Asima Chatterjee was born on 23 September 1917 in Kolkata, India.[3] She was born into a middle-class family which, at the time, meant no education for females.

       She was also the eldest child with a younger brother which meant having more responsibilities in an Indian family as you become the face of the new generation.[4] Her father Indra Narayan Mookerjee was a doctor and was very supportive of Asima and her brother’s education, which was rare at the time. Her father loved Botany, this was where she developed her interest in medicine.

        She later joined the University College of Science at the University of Calcutta as a Reader in pure Chemistry. She continued her research on the nature of biologically active compounds found in medicinal plants.

        She was the first female to receive a doctorate and even started a chemistry department in the Lady Brabourne College of the University of Calcutta.
